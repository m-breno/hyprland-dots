I don't recommend you to copy my entire workflow, just use it as an example for your rice, then, do this as your own risk.

I don't know all the programs that I used for make this rice, and I am too lazy for search in my history to see what I downloaded.

I hope I helped you, thanks.

PS: sorry for my bad english, i'm brazillian
